        <h1> FUNDAMENTALS OF NURSING </h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p> The fundamentals of nursing are the core principles, knowledge, and skills that form the basis of safe, effective, and compassionate patient care. These fundamentals begin with an understanding of basic human needs—physical, emotional, psychological, social, and spiritual—and how illness or injury can affect a person's overall well-being. Central to nursing practice is the nursing process, a systematic method involving assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation, which guides nurses in delivering individualized care. Nurses must be skilled in monitoring vital signs, administering medications, performing basic procedures, and maintaining hygiene and infection control to ensure patient safety and comfort. Effective communication with patients, families, and healthcare teams is essential for building trust, promoting education, and coordinating care. Proper documentation of patient information is also a critical legal and ethical responsibility. In addition, nurses must demonstrate professionalism, cultural sensitivity, empathy, and strong ethical judgment, as they often serve as advocates for their patients. These fundamental concepts prepare nurses to provide holistic, patient-centered care in a variety of healthcare settings, laying the groundwork for more advanced practice and specialization. </p>
